Run: ./node_modules/.bin/webpack -d

Hi there!
First of all, this is not the best version of this project, I'll update and improve it later. As it turned out, the time wasn't enough for me.
I see dozens of improvements not only in functionality but in navigation/ui/ux too.

For storing images I used API of this service - https://cloudinary.com/.
Adding (I saved data to local JSON), editing and deleting emulated on the client side.
